# Cookie-Cutter
Hackathon Cookie cutter (Dalgona) made by me, during the MLSA event Eye S.py KIIT 2023. 
The concept is based on the Dalgona game from Squid Game Korean Drame.
It uses computer Vision to detect movement of the index on camera.

Press 'Q' to start the game.
Bring your hand upto the camera and wait until it shows a skeleton layout.
Then fold your fingers keeping only the index finger up, bring it to the blue starting point.
As soon as countdown starts, start tracing the shape around the darker lines, avoiding going too far out.
After finished tracing the shape the game will end
